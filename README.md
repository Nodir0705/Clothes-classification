# First steps of AI, with clothes classification project
In this notebook, we will step through how artificial neural networks have improved over the years and the biological inspiration behind it.  To demonstrate, we will be using TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library popular in industry. Recent versions of TensorFlow automatically detect if there is a GPU available for computation.
